# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-feather-pointed" %}Join us

We are always looking for motivated students to join our research projects.

# For Prospective PhD Students
Please send your CV, transcripts, and GRE/TOEFL scores (if applicable) to ryu5 [at] ncsu [dot] edu.
In your email, feel free to use up to 2 sentences to briefly describe the type / area of research you want to conduct as a PhD student.  
**Note: please start your email's subject line with "[Future-PhD]" (without quotes) to ensure proper delivery of the email.**

# For Current NCSU Graduate and Undergraduate Students

We will post our openings on this page. Please check the details in the posts and contact the corresponding person if you are interested.

You can also send an email to ryu5 [at] ncsu [dot] edu with some details: your program (Undergrad/MS/PhD) and year, current research/research interests, CV, and transcripts. If you have taken or are taking one of Dr. Yu's classes, please also indicate that, and attach your grade of the course if available. We may set up a meeting to discuss if our interests align, what course you should take, and the availability of a research position, if we both have time and are interested.  
**Note: please start your email's subject line with "[Current-\<Program\>]" (without quotes, substitute \<Program\> with one of PhD/MS/U) to ensure proper delivery of the email.**
